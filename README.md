# vanilla-wow-addons
This is just my Interface/Addons directory for World of Warcraft 1.12.1. I'm playing on the Kronos 2 server and use the following addons without much error. The two things that you need to know about this set of addons, is that Questie throws an error when entering most instances, so I typically relog to turn Questie off and turn on my CT Raid Assist stuff if I want, then relog and disable when questing. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me in-game with /w Nubbins.
